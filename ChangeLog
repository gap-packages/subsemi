0.71
	Getting rid of duplicated code in the independent set search algorithms by proper abstraction.
0.70
	Using a simple array instead of hashing in SubTableMatchingSearch. It gives speedup and it is compatible with Orb 4.7.5.
0.69
	Adding SubSgpsIncreasingOrder and simplifying the minimal extensions function (consequently removing SubSgpsGenSetsByMinExtensions).
0.68
	FileSubsemigroupsInDecreasingOrder added.
0.67
	Adding SubSgpsInDecreasingOrder using MaximalSubsemigroups.
0.66
	Standardized filename extensions in filing. Improving sgp tags.
0.65
	Removed dependency: the Dust package. The storage code (stacks. queues, etc.) is included here now.
0.64
	FileSubsemigroups rewritten, especially the isomorphism and anti-isomorphim checks.
0.63
	SgpsContaining added. Minimal extensions algorithm does not include the seed subsgp automatically.
0.62
	AutomorphsimGroup now works for semigroups. GrpTag, SgpsDatabase added for the classification of Sub(T4).
0.61
	TagSgpsFromFile added.
0.60
	Classification now checks for 3-nilpotency.
0.59
	Added simplified classification method: SaveTaggedSgps. Separating textprocessing and semigroup tagging code.
0.58
	Replacing AssociativeList with the included classifier in multab.gi and embedding.gi.
0.57
	Replacing DUST's indexed blist storage solution with a simple array of hashtables.
0.56
	Closure functions again have the same signature. Renamings and rearrangings in closure.g*.
0.55
	Closure algorithms got simplified.
0.54
	CLOSED BRANCH! Major architectural change: closure algorithms work on lists only, and blists are only used for storage. (It turns out that plain lists are lot slower.)
0.53
	IsIndependentSet -> IsSgpIndependentSet, to be mathematically precise. Removing experimental code (Expressible).
0.52
	AutGrpOfMulTab added. Removing unused code from filing. GAP 4.8 is now a dependence.
0.51
	Scripts: added 3-nilpotent and maximal subsemigroups. Separating scripts into folders (partially).
0.50
	Regression fix in IsIsomorphiMulTab. Renaming: SortedElements -> Elts. Code review in minextensions.
0.49
	Separating conjugacy code for better readability and maintainability. Simplifying filing.
0.48
	Fixes for isomorphism functions. File reanming: isomorphism -> embedding.
0.47

0.45
	Reworking SubTableMatchingSearch to give all possible embeddings.
0.44

0.43
	Implementing the canonical construction path method for finding independent sets.
0.42
	Making the small degree diagram semigroup classification self-contained (included a partitioned binary relation implementation). Several little improvements for calculating independent sets.
0.41
	Implementing a more efficient conjugacy class representative calculation. Many changes around the independent generator set code.
0.40
	Doing the reflexive transitive reduction of the partial order in filing -> no direct dependence on the digraphs package. Inverse semigroups are also classified.
0.39
	Making tests short-circuit in isomorphism code. Making more tests based on Green's classes data.
0.38
	Introducing the Classify function to abstract several isomorphism class functions.
0.37
	Several improvements of filing and scripts for enumeration/classification. Improving bitstring encoding, NOT BACKWARD COMPATIBLE! New calculation for the number of edges in the Hasse diagram.
0.36
	New dependency: graphs package. Working on enumerating scripts and related changes.
0.35
	Bugfix: no formatting in SaveIndicatorSets. Code clean-up for n-generated subsemigroups.
0.34
	Isomorphism, anti-isomorphism filing done properly in small degree scripts and in GensFileAntiAndIsomClasses.
0.33
	Working on the Sub(T4) recalculation script. Bugfix: general subsets have to be closed by SubSgpsByMinExtensions.
0.32
	Adding functions for testing anti-isomorphism. Bugfix in SubTableMatchingSearch (checking for missing profiles). Fixes in scripts.
0.31
	Reviewing the isomorphism checking code. A bit of abstraction turned it into an embedding algorithm. Many functions became (pseudo)polymorphic, so they take both plain matrices and MulTab objects. A 'user interface' is fitted: high-level functions AllSubsemigroups and ConjugacyClassRepSubsemigroups.
0.30
	GensFileIsomClasses rewritten.
0.29
	Further extensions to SgpTag.
0.28
	SgpTag extended with the number of maximal D-classes and the number of edges in the Hasse diagram of D-classes. Fixing misleading peek in SubSgpsByMinExtensions.
0.27
	Added scripts for enumerating small-degree diagram semigroups. Improved filing.
0.26
	Improved semigroup tagging and new memory-efficient filing function.
0.25
	Improving the calculation of isomorphism classes: preclassifying by the number of idempotents.
0.24
	Further tree pruning in SubSgpsByMinExtensions by the normalizer of the subsemigroup (James). Checkpointing added. Several small corrections, commenting.
0.23
	SubSemiTestAll/TestInstall now separated. Symmetric inverse semigroup test added. Unnecessary (used only once) functions removed.
0.22
	Improved filing script.
0.21
	SubSgpsByUpperTorsos is the correct function name.
0.20
	Separating upper torso calculation. It is now possible not to calculate the ideal again (empty upper torso can be removed).
0.19
	BUGFIX: in minextensions.gi, removing the generators already in the baseset caused losses in the torso calculation.
0.18
	IsomorphismSemigroups -> IsomorphismSemigroupsByMulTabs, following upstream changes.
0.17
	NilPotencyDegreeByMulTabs added.
0.16

0.15
	Reviewing the isomorphism code. ElementProfileLookup added. Improving Is3NilPotent.
0.14
	Just renaming to follow the paper's terminology: minimal closures to minimal extensions.
0.13
	Removing equivalent generators is done only once for the minimal closure method.
0.12
	Added possibility to search for minimal generating sets as well. This required the minimal closure search to change to breadth-first. Depth-first is still possible.
0.11
	Reviewing closures. Finetuning logging and dumping in SubSgpsByMinClosures. FullSet, EmptySet now attributes.
0.10
	1Extension renamed to MinClosure.
0.9
	IsClosedSubTable added. SubSgpsBy1ExtensionsParametrized added enabling faster torso combinations. The empty semigroup is returned now as a subsemigroup.

0.7
	SgpInMulTab can be given different closure functions.
0.6
	Alternative closure method added, further work on combining ideals, simplifications.
0.5
	Lot of work on enumerating by parallel search for ideals.
0.4
	MulTab now is an attribute storing object, so no more record references.
0.3
	Adding invariants for both element and multiplication table level.
0.2
	Adding test cases, checking against brute-force methods. Converting between the indicator set (bitlist) and the subsets of semigroups.
0.1
	Working 1-extension method transferred, but poor package structure, no test cases yet.
