0.86
	Reviving the package for GAP 4.14.0. Protecting the internal Stack and Queue implementation by @. Since they are part of a storage framework, it is not immediate to switch to the external implementations. NrEdgesInHasseDiagramOfDClasses removed as PartialOrderOfDClasses is a Hasse diagram now.
0.85

0.78
	Revising the code for enumerating subsemigroups along an ideal. Mainly driven by the need for simplifying downstream enumeration scripts.
0.77
	Reorganize the code for semigroup embeddings. Shell-scripts for handling semigroup databases.
0.76
	Update release following GAP 4.8.2.
0.75
	Constructing embeddings by backtrack does less checks by checking the new element first. This makes the calculation several times faster.

0.63

0.56
	Closure functions again have the same signature. Renamings and rearrangings in closure.g*.
0.55
	Closure algorithms got simplified.
0.54
	CLOSED BRANCH! Major architectural change: closure algorithms work on lists only, and blists are only used for storage. (It turns out that plain lists are lot slower.)
0.53
	IsIndependentSet -> IsSgpIndependentSet, to be mathematically precise. Removing experimental code (Expressible).
0.52
	AutGrpOfMulTab added. Removing unused code from filing. GAP 4.8 is now a dependence.

	Implementing a more efficient conjugacy class representative calculation. Many changes around the independent generator set code.
0.40
	Doing the reflexive transitive reduction of the partial order in filing -> no direct dependence on the digraphs package. Inverse semigroups are also classified.

0.32
	Adding functions for testing anti-isomorphism. Bugfix in SubTableMatchingSearch (checking for missing profiles). Fixes in scripts.
0.31
	Reviewing the isomorphism checking code. A bit of abstraction turned it into an embedding algorithm. Many functions became (pseudo)polymorphic, so they take both plain matrices and MulTab objects. A 'user interface' is fitted: high-level functions AllSubsemigroups and ConjugacyClassRepSubsemigroups.
0.30
	GensFileIsomClasses rewritten.
0.29
	Further extensions to SgpTag.

0.18
	IsomorphismSemigroups -> IsomorphismSemigroupsByMulTabs, following upstream changes.
0.17
	NilPotencyDegreeByMulTabs added.

	Just renaming to follow the paper's terminology: minimal closures to minimal extensions.
0.13
	Removing equivalent generators is done only once for the minimal closure method.
0.12
	Added possibility to search for minimal generating sets as well. This required the minimal closure search to change to breadth-first. Depth-first is still possible.
0.11
	Reviewing closures. Finetuning logging and dumping in SubSgpsByMinClosures. FullSet, EmptySet now attributes.
0.10
	1Extension renamed to MinClosure.
0.9

0.2
	Adding test cases, checking against brute-force methods. Converting between the indicator set (bitlist) and the subsets of semigroups.
0.1
	Working 1-extension method transferred, but poor package structure, no test cases yet.
